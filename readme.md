    ## Description

    To create a node.js app that could create a high quality README file based on some prompts from Inquirer

    I built this project as an exercise to the assignment for Module 9

    It solves the issue of manually inputting data into a README file

    I learned to use node and different modules in order to create, store, and populate data
