 ## Installation 

    For this project we had to install the inquirer and jest packages from node in order to prompt the user for their inputs as well as test the reliability of our code. Node can be installed form their website and once that's completed, you should be able to download inquirer and jest using "npm i inquirer jest" in the terminal.
